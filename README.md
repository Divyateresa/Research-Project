ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION FOR TASK‐ORIENTED NETWORKS AND INTELLIGENT COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
We initiate this project for the purpose of reducing the computation cost. The Energy required to transfer a
single bit costs a lot in terms of computation and communication. In later 2018, Telecom operators accounted
for around 5 percent of operating expenditures considered only for computation; they account for 2 to 3
percent of total global energy demand, often making them some of the most energy-intensive companies
in their geographic markets. As an operator’s energy consumption exceeds the limit due to an increasing
amount of population, it increases their carbon footprint and tends to harm the environment unintentionally.
Therefore, we figured out an optimal way to reduce the computation cost in an energy efficient way.
